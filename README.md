## Source code install

To install and run Edge Node Launcher, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Ratio1/edge_node_launcher.git
   cd edge_node_launcher
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Building the Application

The repository uses GitHub Actions to build and release binaries for different platforms (Windows, Ubuntu 22.04, and Ubuntu 20.04). The build process includes:

- Checking the version in `ver.py` and comparing it with the latest release version
- Building the application using PyInstaller
- Zipping the built artifacts and uploading them as release assets

## Usage

### Editing Environment Files

To edit the `.env` file used by the Docker container, click the "Edit .env File" button. The file will open in a text editor within the application. After making changes, save the file and close the editor.

### Checking Docker Availability

The application checks for Docker availability at startup. If Docker is not installed, you will be prompted to install it.

### Launching and Stopping Docker Containers

Use the "Launch Container" button to start the Docker container. If the container is already running, the button will show "Stop Container" to allow stopping the container.

### Viewing Plots

The application displays plots for CPU load, memory load, GPU load, and GPU memory load. The plots are updated every 10 seconds with data from a JSON file.

### Updating the Application

The application can check for updates, download the latest release, and replace the current executable. To check for updates, ensure you have an internet connection and the application will handle the rest.

## Development

### Code Structure

- `main.py`: Entry point for the application
- `app_forms/frm_main.py`: Main application form and logic
- `utils/const.py`: Constants used throughout the application
- `utils/docker.py`: Docker utility functions

### Stylesheets

The application uses stylesheets for UI theming. The stylesheets are defined in `utils/const.py` and applied to various widgets.
